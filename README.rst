spynoza
~~~~~~~
python package for fMRI data processing

Prerequisites
-------------
Spynoza uses Nipype to organize processing workflows.

Setup and git workflow
----------------------
CD to a folder where you want the spynoza git to be setup.
To clone the repo into that dir run::

    $ git clone git@github.com:spinoza-center/spynoza.git`

This cloned the master branch into the repo. We also need the develop branch.
To create a new branch that syncs with the upstream develop branch run
(no need to run additional pull)::

    $ git checkout --track origin/develop

This ensures that when you run `git pull` from the develop branch,
it syncs with the origin/develop branch (instead of origin/master).

Now we'll want to create our own feature branch to start working on our
contribution. We can branch off of develop by running::

    $ git checkout -b my_feature develop

To get an overview of the branches we've created, run::

    $ git branch

To switch to another branch run::

    $ git checkout branch_name

When working on your feature, make sure you first switch to your feature branch.
Then, do your work, and run::

    $ git commit -am "Your message"

Make sure you have a seperate feature branch for every distinct feature you're implementing.

When your feature is finished, and you'd like to share it with your collaborators,
merge your changes in develop without a fast-forward. First switch to the develop branch::

    $ git checkout develop

Then merge your feature changes into develop::

    $ git merge --no-ff my_feature

Now push changes to the server

    $ git push origin develop
    $ git push origin my_feature

You are now free to delete your own feature branch if you wish using::

    $ git branch -d my_feature
